What You're Aiming For

Checkpoint: Hosting a MERN App on Microsoft Azure

Objective: To deploy a MERN stack application on Microsoft Azure cloud platform.

Instructions

Prepare Your MERN Application:

Ensure that your MERN application is fully developed and tested locally.
Make sure your application's backend (Node.js/Express) is connected to MongoDB for data storage.
Create a Microsoft Azure Account:

If you haven't already, sign up for a Microsoft Azure account.
Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the dashboard.
Set Up MongoDB Atlas:

Since Azure doesn't offer MongoDB as a service directly, use MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB's cloud service) for your database.
Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account if you don't have one already.
Create a new MongoDB cluster and configure it according to your application's requirements.
Prepare Your MERN App for Deployment:

Update your MERN application's configuration to use environment variables for sensitive data like database credentials.
Build your React frontend for production using npm run build.
Create an Azure Web App Service:

In the Azure Portal, navigate to "Create a resource" > "Web" > "Web App".
Fill in the required details like app name, resource group, and region.
Choose the appropriate pricing tier based on your requirements.
Set Up Deployment Source:

In your Azure Web App's settings, navigate to "Deployment Center".
Choose the deployment source as "Local Git" or connect to your preferred version control system (e.g., GitHub).
Deploy Your MERN App:

If using Local Git, clone your Azure Web App's Git repository to your local machine.
Copy your built React frontend files to a folder within your backend project (e.g., server/public).
Commit and push your changes to Azure's Git repository.
Azure will automatically detect changes and deploy your application.
Configure Environment Variables:

In your Azure Web App's settings, navigate to "Configuration".
Set environment variables for your MERN application, including MongoDB connection string and other required configurations.
Test Your Deployed MERN App:

Access your deployed MERN application through the URL provided by Azure.
Test all functionalities to ensure proper deployment and database connectivity.
